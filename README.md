# netaddition

dump of my files related to netaddtion (see [1]).

The most important part is in folder `netadddsl`.
It contains the antlr rules to the create some grgen model.

The folders `./coffee_capp_stn_na` and `./petri_net_addition` are examples how the .na files can look. The `./petri_net_addition` is an
implementation of some algorithms of [2]. Some changes I did was to replace priority-transitions with inhibitor arcs.
